# Dia Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page designed according to a Figma prototype, following modern frontend best practices. The page is built using BEM methodology and SCSS for clean, maintainable styles.

It showcases a fully structured layout including: header with navigation, Strategic agency block, slider, Who we are block, Our expertise, Process, Testimonials, Vision-Passion-Results, Send us a message, Contact us, and footer.

The design is fully responsive across multiple screen sizes:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:

- Implement Figma designs pixel-perfectly.
